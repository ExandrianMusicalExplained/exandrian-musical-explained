<h2>02 - Emon's Fall

<p>Jumping ahead in the first act, with a refrain of the opening verse, Aaron Burr and Alexander Hamilton reflect on their shared love for women,
as they attend a ball where they meet the Schuyler sisters, of which Eliza would be Hamilton's eventual wife.
</p><h3>To Exandria

<p>In a similar vein, Emon's Fall starts with Scanlan and Grog reflecting on their shared affinity for houses of lady favors.
Of special note, the line &quot;there are so many to deflower!&quot; comes verbatim from the Hamilton track.
It then takes a turn, as the party and particularly Vax are unsure of their purpose as they seem to be aimlessly causing trouble.
</p><p>As if on cue, the resignation speech of Uriel Tal'Dorei III, the sovereign of the continent of Tal'Dorei and its capitol Emon,
is interrupted when the Chroma Conclave attacks Emon, also taking the sovereign's life.
The Chroma Conclave was an abnormal cooperation between five evil chromatic dragons--
four after Brimscythe, the blue dragon, was killed by the party earlier in the campaign as he infiltrated and corrupted the council of Emon.
