<p>Following A Winter's Ball, Helpless tells the tale of Eliza Schuyler being enraptured by Alexander Hamilton and subsequently his asking for her hand in marriage.

<p>Similarly following Emon's Fall but with a much darker tone, in the Exandrian musical Helpless tells the tale of the city of Emon
being powerless against the invading Chroma Conclave of four ancient evil chromatic dragons.
</p><p>Vorugal, AKA the Frigid Doom, the white dragon, first takes down Allura's wizard tower, as Raishan, the green dragon,
demolishes the crowd and the council of Emon with poison breath. Vox Machina narrowly escapes with Keyleth's Transport via Plants spell
to Greyskull Keep just outside of Emon, as Thordak, the Cinder King, the massive red dragon and leader of the conclave,
arrives smashing into the central palace of Emon, and sends the others off to the east.
The party had encountered Thordak before in the Fire Plane, avoiding his distant gaze as they completed the Fire Ashari's task for Keyleth's Aramente.
</p><p>Vorugal lays siege to Greyskull Keep despite Thordak's orders until Thordak tackles him and sends him away so he can have Emon to himself.
Gilmore had last been seen before the attack and his whereabouts were unknown.
