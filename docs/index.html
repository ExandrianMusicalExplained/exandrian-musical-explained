        <p><strong>WARNING: Spoilers abound for Campaign 1 of Critical Role, and the story of the Hamilton musical upon which the Exandrian musical was based.</strong>
I highly recommend experiencing the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjQpKlmn_hsUCFFvkYW2uQDj_cRmS0Tlo">Hamilton musical</a> in its intended order yourself.
Check out the homepage of <a href="http://www.willcrosswait.com/cpan/">The Cantata Pansophical</a>, the wonderful artists that came together to create the Exandrian musical.
</p><h2>A Foreword
</h2><p>Dearest reader,
</p><p>I, Ser Taryon Darrington, leader and founder of the Darrington Brigade and accomplished author and poet,
came across this wonderful performance honoring my slightly less accomplished friends from my old adventuring party, Vox Machina.
To assist those less familiar with their exploits, I have had my faithful second Chod--
strike that, Doty, we should use his stage name Lionel-- write up some background information to explain all of the references.
He did not put quite as much flair into it as I would have liked, and he's a bit of a quack, but he's been reading quite a bit,
he said something about &quot;that other barbarian is catching up to me again.&quot; I do hope you find the results satisfactory.
</p><p>Darringly yours,
</p><p>Ser Taryon Darrington
