      <h2>01 - The Party Called Vox Machina
</h2><h3>From Hamilton - Alexander Hamilton
</h3><iframe id="ytplayer" type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VhinPd5RRJw" frameborder="0">

<p>The opening track of Hamilton is an expository introduction to the eponymous Alexander, detailing where he came from with narration by each of the major characters with an interlude by Hamilton, and ending in rapid fire glimpses of those he would interact with and his eventual end.
</p><h3>To Exandria

<p>Appropriately also the opening track of the Exandrian musical, we start things off with Shaun Gilmore,
the magnificent and beloved human Runechild sorcerer and proprietor of a magic shop called Gilmore's Glorious Goods.
He and the other major party NPCs then introduce each party member and their origins.
</p><p>Allura Vysoren, a human wizard with a tower in the city of Emon, introduces the half-elven twins Vex'ahlia and Vax'ildan.
Their father was an elven diplomat of Syngorn, and their mother a humble seamstress.
They were taken in by their father but, due to his detached demeanor, struck off on their own as a rogue and ranger team.
The tough critter they raise is Vex's Beastmaster ranger companion, a bear named Trinket.
</p><p>Kima, a fierce halfling paladin who the party previously rescued from the Underdark at the behest of Allura,
details the origins of Grog Strongjaw the goliath barbarian. He became disillusioned with his family and tribe,
the Herd of Storms, due to their merciless destruction, but couldn't leave without invoking their wrath.
</p><p>Allura introduces Percival Fredrickstein Von Musel Klossowski de Rolo III,
or Percy for short, a human gunslinger and child of a noble family in Whitestone.
His family and home city were destroyed by Lord and Lady Briarwood, an event which led to a deal with a demon and the invention of firearms.
With the help of Vox Machina he would later return and defeat the Briarwoods to reclaim the castle and town of Whitestone,
and find his sister Cassandra still alive. He would defeat the demon Orthax after refusing to kill his sister for betraying the party.
Dr. Anna Ripley was found trying to replicate his work, and Percy would take her first pistol (Retort) as she fled.
</p><p>Kima introduces Pike Trickfoot, a gnome cleric of Sarenrae, the Everlight, a goddess of redemption, healing, and temperance.
Gilmore gives a lead-in to Scanlan Shortholt, a gnome bard, who delightfully co-opts the refrain &quot;Just you wait!&quot;
</p><p>Allura narrates how Grog defended Pike's great-great-grandfather Wilhand from his Herd's slaughter in Westruun,
resulting in the Herd turning on him and leaving him for dead, but Pike nurses him back to health, beginning their long friendship.
</p><p>Kima introduces Keyleth the half-elven druid of the Air Ashari, one of four druidic tribes guarding rifts into the elemental planes.
Keyleth's mother left on the Aramente, a journey to seek out the other tribes and venture to their planes, to ultimately take up the mantle to become the leader of their tribe.
When Keyleth's mother didn't return, Keyleth set off to take the journey herself.
Keyleth had visited and completed the task for the Earth Ashari in Terrah already,
and with Vox Machina visited the Fire Ashari in Pyrah, traveling to the Fire Plane to complete their task.
</p><p>Gilmore refers to their original name, the S.H.I.T.S. (Super High-Intensity Team).
Through their exploits they would earn a home base in Greyskull Keep from the city of Emon, and take on the more marketable name Vox Machina.
</p><p>Allura, Kima, and Gilmore all would fight with the party and become their close friends.
Gilmore sponsored the party, providing them a discount at his shop in exchange for advertisement.

      <h2>02 - Emon's Fall
</h2><h3>From Hamilton - A Winter's Ball
</h3><iframe id="ytplayer" type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WO8Z6S7oHTw" frameborder="0">
</iframe>
<p>Jumping ahead in the first act, with a refrain of the opening verse, Aaron Burr and Alexander Hamilton reflect on their shared love for women,
as they attend a ball where they meet the Schuyler sisters, of which Eliza would be Hamilton's eventual wife.
</p><h3>To Exandria
</h3><iframe id="ytplayer" type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HkAyvGhKvHs" frameborder="0">

<p>In a similar vein, Emon's Fall starts with Scanlan and Grog reflecting on their shared affinity for houses of lady favors.
Of special note, the line &quot;there are so many to deflower!&quot; comes verbatim from the Hamilton track.
It then takes a turn, as the party and particularly Vax are unsure of their purpose as they seem to be aimlessly causing trouble.
</p><p>As if on cue, the resignation speech of Uriel Tal'Dorei III, the sovereign of the continent of Tal'Dorei and its capitol Emon,
is interrupted when the Chroma Conclave attacks Emon, also taking the sovereign's life.
The Chroma Conclave was an abnormal cooperation between five evil chromatic dragons--
four after Brimscythe, the blue dragon, was killed by the party earlier in the campaign as he infiltrated and corrupted the council of Emon.

      <h2>03 - Helpless
</h2><h3>From Hamilton - Helpless
</h3><iframe id="ytplayer" type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6frd_dHxPRs" frameborder="0">

<p>Following A Winter's Ball, Helpless tells the tale of Eliza Schuyler being enraptured by Alexander Hamilton and subsequently his asking for her hand in marriage.
</p><h3>To Exandria
</h3><iframe id="ytplayer" type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KWzAI30XWGU" frameborder="0">
</iframe>
<p>Similarly following Emon's Fall but with a much darker tone, in the Exandrian musical Helpless tells the tale of the city of Emon
being powerless against the invading Chroma Conclave of four ancient evil chromatic dragons.
</p><p>Vorugal, AKA the Frigid Doom, the white dragon, first takes down Allura's wizard tower, as Raishan, the green dragon,
demolishes the crowd and the council of Emon with poison breath. Vox Machina narrowly escapes with Keyleth's Transport via Plants spell
to Greyskull Keep just outside of Emon, as Thordak, the Cinder King, the massive red dragon and leader of the conclave,
arrives smashing into the central palace of Emon, and sends the others off to the east.
The party had encountered Thordak before in the Fire Plane, avoiding his distant gaze as they completed the Fire Ashari's task for Keyleth's Aramente.
</p><p>Vorugal lays siege to Greyskull Keep despite Thordak's orders until Thordak tackles him and sends him away so he can have Emon to himself.
Gilmore had last been seen before the attack and his whereabouts were unknown.
