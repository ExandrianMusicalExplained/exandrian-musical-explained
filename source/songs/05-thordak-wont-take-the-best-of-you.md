As the skull debate winds down, Allura arrives and is told of the attacking Conclave.
She reveals that she adventured with Kima and others long ago and fought Thordak the Cinder King,
finally trapping him in the Fire Plane 15 years ago, but at the cost of three of their party;
only Allura, Kima, and Drake Thunderbrand survived.

It is also revealed that Thordak was the dragon that destroyed the town of Byroden
and killed the mother of Vex and Vax while they were staying with their father;
and that Pyrah, where the Fire Ashari guarded a portal to the Fire Plane,
has been destroyed in Thordak's apparent escape from the plane.
