**WARNING: Spoilers abound for Campaign 1 of Critical Role, and the story of the Hamilton musical upon which the Exandrian musical was based.**
I highly recommend experiencing the [Hamilton musical](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjQpKlmn_hsUCFFvkYW2uQDj_cRmS0Tlo) in its intended order yourself.
Check out the homepage of [The Cantata Pansophical](http://www.willcrosswait.com/cpan/), the wonderful artists that came together to create the Exandrian musical.
